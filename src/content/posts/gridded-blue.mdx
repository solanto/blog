# a gridded media viewer for bluesky

I made a web app to view Bluesky accounts' media in a grid, just like on Pixelfed or Instagram! Check it out at [gridded.blue](https://gridded.blue).

The site's source is [on GitHub](https://github.com/solanto/gridded.blue).

[![A screenshot of gridded.blue's UI, viewing @bsky.app's profile. The page header has controls for which and whose images are shown. After @bsky.app's profile and bio, three of their posted images form their first row of media.](../../assets/posts/gridded-blue/screenshot.avif)](https://gridded.blue/view?profile=bsky.app)

## joy in new tech

- [atproto](https://atproto.com/) is a blast to use
- the [ITEF](https://www.ietf.org/)'s proposed [JWT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) method for cryptographically-secured exchanges is super cool
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)'s [session management tools](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/sessions/) are incredibly easy to get started with
