# a gridded media viewer for bluesky

I made a web app to view Bluesky accounts' media in a grid, just like on Pixelfed or Instagram! Check it out at [gridded.blue](https://gridded.blue).

The site's source is [on GitHub](https://github.com/solanto/gridded.blue).

After @bsky.app's profile and bio, three of their posted images form their first row of media.](../../assets/posts/gridded.blue/screenshot.avif)](https://gridded.blue/view?profile=bsky.app)
