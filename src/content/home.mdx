Hey, there! 🐸 I customarily go by Andrew --(he/him)--, Andrés --(él)--, André --(il ; ele)--, Anders --(han/honom)--, or anything of the sort. I proudly call [Baltimore, Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore), home.

Perhaps imprudently—I was handed a laptop when I turned eight. I've been coding, tinkering, and practically devouring the internet ever since. These days, you'll also find me:

- Tending to my houseplants.
- Working on DIY tech projects (like this website!).
- Listening to alt/indie pop and jazz on repeat.
- On research deep-dives.
- Crocheting.

I earned a college certificate in mechanical engineering design technology [--(El Camino College)--](https://www.elcamino.edu) and a B.S. in systems engineering [--(Johns Hopkins University)--](https://jhu.edu); I work in public transit administration by day.
